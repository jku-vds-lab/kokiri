Kokiri ðŸŒ³ [![Phovea][phovea-image]][phovea-url]
=====================

Kokiri is a visual analytics approach to compare and characterize cohorts.

Users can interactively compare cohorts by their high dimensional data, explore the driving differences, and characterize the homogeneity and outliers of the cohorts

Kokiri can be utilized to compare any type of cohort. Our focus, however, is on the analysis of genomic data from cancer patients.
